Depending on your use case, there are multiple ways of installing the
GRR server components. Most users will want to
[install a release deb](from-release-deb.md). The server deb includes
client templates that can be downloaded from GRR's Admin UI after installation.

Alternatively, GRR can be [installed from PIP](from-released-pip.md).

You can install also GRR from source as described
[here](from-source.md). You should then be able to modify GRR code and build
your own server/client installers.
